create a physics simulation in html of container full of gas molecules. The moleculs should be simple diatomic helium gas molecules. also in additikon to collision physics also add correcions for van der wals forces and apply distortion to mechjanics of the moleculs based on these forces



create  a simple 2d demonstration of the aboce in html to the level of complexity that you can code


using the mass of heliuum nucleus and the speeds of the gas molecules have label that outputs the temparature of the boix at any instant. use statistical mechanics to calculate the temparaturew



update above code to add the label in html below the gas container. to the right of the gas container have a small box rthat explains the kinetic theorey of gases and haver the relavent equation below nit
